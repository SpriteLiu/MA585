# Problem 6(b)
```{r}
set.seed(1)
n <- 10000
theta <- 50
N <- rpois(n,theta)
sample <- sample(c(50,100,200),n,replace=T,prob=c(0.3,0.5,0.2))
TN <- rep(0,10000)
for(i in 1:10000)
{
TN[i]<- sum(sample[1:N[i]])
}
mean(TN)
var(TN)
```
The sample mean should be 5250 and the sample variance should be 687500, we can see that the result has some differences. I also tried to delete "set.seed(1)" and run the R code several times, the result is sometimes larger and sometimes smaller, so the result seems reasonable.
